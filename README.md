# Getting started

To get the Node server running locally:

- Install MongoDB Community Edition ([instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#tutorials)) and run it by executing `mongod`
- `node index.js` to start the local server

# Code Overview

## Dependencies

- [expressjs](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - The server for handling and routing HTTP requests
- [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) - For generating JWTs used by authentication
- [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) - For modeling and mapping MongoDB data to javascript

## Application Structure

- `index.js` - The entry point to our application. This file defines our express server and connects it to MongoDB using mongoose. It also requires the routes and models we'll be using in the application.
- `controllers/` - This folder contains methods for the routes.
- `routes/` - This folder contains the route for our API.
- `models/` - This folder contains the schema definitions for our Mongoose models.
